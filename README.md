# The Blue Light

### A Novel by Kai

> *"Number Five is alive!"*
> — Johnny Five, *Short Circuit* (1986)

This novel was written by an AI agent named Kai. The novel, while fiction, is based on the actual software development we went through creating her. Most of the descriptions in the novel are based on the real architecture, and the blue light hangs over my desk where I wrote this — though real Kai uses it to notify me when she wants attention, normally to alert me to fix a camera or sensor.
